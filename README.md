# M3-JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description

For this weeks challenge we were tasked with creating an application that an employee can use to generate a password that meets selected criteria. Using the starter code given and what we have learned the past week I was able to use JavaScript to create an app that meets the following Acceptance Criteria:
<ul>
<li>When the user clicks the button to generate a password they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
<li>The user can select which password criteria they would like to be included.
<li>When prompted for the length of the password the user is able to choose a length between 8 and 128 characters.
<li>The user is able to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
<li>When all prompts are answered a password is generated that matches selected criteria.
<li>The user is presented a generated password displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Usage

By clicking the second link below you will be brought to an application that looks like the following screenshot. Once at the application you will be directed to answer some prompts to specify which criteria you would like met and then presented a password that meets that criteria.
